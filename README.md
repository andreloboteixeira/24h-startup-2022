startup-24 event

todo: 

- bug of overlays when booking

- debug the schedule function in more detail, there are certain tee times that appear no to be ever updated

- PWA UI improvements: picture is too large, maybe some background image, restrict the horizontal space for large screens, better positioning of the date picker label, and tee time cards

- disable selection of old dates, expand the database to have more future data to allow for future predictions (would need to upgrade to openWeather api forecasting)

- tee times are currently set to an hour, this time is normally shorter (10 min). This could be a parameter for future data generation
